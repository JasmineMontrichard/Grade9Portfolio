            <p class='h3Class sectionTab'>Learning from Specific Mistakes:</p>
            <div class='sectionTab'>
                <ul class='listSpacing'>
                    <li>For my Universe assignment, I put the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag after the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and was confused on why spacing was a lot greater than what was shown in the assignment's output. I put the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag before the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> ending tag, and I learned that there was a spacing difference.</li>
                    <li>For my Unit 2 test, there was a question asking about bullet points and its appearance for list items. After my test was graded, I learned that the only way you can change how bullet points look is through CSS.</li>
                    <li>For one of my learning tasks in Unit 4, we had to add the <code>float</code> property to the image. But I misunderstood the instruction and added the <code>float</code> property to the header above the image, and I became confused. I learned that the image will go beside the header and not below it.</li>

                <ul class='listSpacing'>
                    <li>It will be easier for me to remember tags, including their usage and syntax when writing my code.</li>
                    <li>It will help me practice good coding habits, such as: using external css instead of internal, using classes and not the <code>style</code> attribute.</li>
                    <li>It will help me find better solutions when writing code.</li>

            <p class='h3Class sectionTab'>Formatting Issues:</p>
            <div class='sectionTab'>
                <ul class='listSpacing'>
                    <li>I made a mistake where I was trying to style a navigation bar without affecting the other lists. I used a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag for the navigation bar and was trying to find a solution for having the style only apply to the navigation bar. I looked through my notes and remembered that you can make styles for restricted classes.</li>
                    <li>I used the W3 HTML & CSS Validators to check my code for any issues and suggestions that I can make when I am writing my code.</li>
                    <li>I had an issue where I was trying to add spacing to the credits in my footer. I was going to have <em>© Copyright 2021&emsp;&emsp;Jasmine Montrichard</em> as the content for the footer and want to have spacing between <em>© Copyright 2021</em> and my full name. I tried using the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag and I did not like the font it gave the text. I remembered that there are character entities for different spaces, so I looked up the unicode spacing size comparison chart. Then, I typed the character entity and it looked the way I intended it to be.</li>
