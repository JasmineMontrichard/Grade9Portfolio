### Background
The purpose of this portfolio was to reflect on my learning experience throughout my Introduction to HTML & CSS courses (COMP10265 & COMP10266), apply the skills and knowledge I learned, and provide an overview of all the projects I worked on. The webpage included a navigation bar and an overarching theme of blue, purple, and white.

### Notes
* Created as part of my Grade 9 Portfolio website for COMP10266.
